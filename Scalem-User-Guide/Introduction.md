# Introduction: Purpose, Goal, Terminology

If you read about Unreal scalability, the topic often involves managing multiple different target machines and running lots of tests.
Gathering all this data and managing it is an annoying task and often involves manual input into a large spreadsheet, and copying various settings over to Unreal.

Scalem tries to make this process much easier by managing the target machines for you.
It doesn't take away every task though, but it should help you focus on what actually counts.

In addition to that, Scalem also processes the data and presents it visually, and provides tools that help you find the best scalability settings for your project.
