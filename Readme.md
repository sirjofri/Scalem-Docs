## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by creating issues and sending patches.

### Creating Issues

Right now, I don't have a structured way to manage this, so feel free to just create the issue.

- The description should be clear enough to get a good idea about the issue.
- The label should match the importance and the content. If in doubt, don't set a label.
- The issue should make clear:
  - Which part of the documentation is affected
  - What's the issue with that part
  - Optional: How to fix the issue
- Spelling mistakes: Please report them or send a patch.
  However, I ask you to not report individual spelling mistakes, but take your time to read a larger portion around the mistake to potentially find more mistakes.

### Sending Patches

There are multiple ways to send patches:

- Forking and sending merge requests
- Uploading a diff/patch file to an issue
- Copy/Pasting the diff to an issue (or something similar)

Whichever way you choose, the changes should fit into the existing structure and make sense.

## Writing Style and Content

- Follow the "one sentence/idea per line" paradigm.
  This is ideal for line-based diff tools like git.
  - It is ok to stretch this idea where it makes sense. For example, a bullet point with two small sentences is often easier to maintain on one line.
- Write correct English.
  - While it is ok to be a bit unformal, please use the correct spelling and proper words.
  - I'm personally not a native English speaker. Feel free to correct me.

### Links and References

It is advised to link to existing documentation if:

- The linked document is quite static (doesn't change the URL very often and the content is only updated)
- The source of the linked document is trusted (e.g., the official documentation, well-known community members like Unreal Garden, Tom Looman, ...)
- The linked document is safe (no malware)
- The linked document is easy to read (no _annoying_ ads, no "scroll an eternity to reach the content")
- The linked document is English. It is ok for the site itself to be in a different language, but the document content must be English language.
