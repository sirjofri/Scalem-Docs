## How to Read this Documentation

In the beginning, you'll get a list of common terms that are used within the whole documentation.
Most terms can be understood from the context, but in case of misunderstandings, you can always refer to the "definitions" in that document. 

Because scalability is a complex topic and Scalem uses Unreal standards, this documentation will also guide you through Unreal scalability in general.
This first part should help you understand how Unreal does scalability, fully independent of Scalem itself.
Everything mentioned in that part applies to your projects whether you're using Scalem or not.

The second part is about Scalem itself.
It builds on top of the knowledge you gained from the first part, so I recommend reading that part first.
You'll learn about the general layout of the Scalem windows and how to use them.
If you want to jump into the cold water, you can also access the [Scalem How to](Scalem-User-Guide/How-to-Use/index.md) immediately.
